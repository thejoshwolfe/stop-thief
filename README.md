# Stop Thief: Electronic Cops and Robbers: Electronic Crime Scanner App

Web app that recreates the behavior of the Electronic Crime Scanner(TM) from the board game Stop Thief: Electronic Cops and Robbers published by Parker Brothers in 1979.

# Status

Mechanically, the app is technically feature complete, but looks terrible and has numerous usability issues.

* TODO: persist game state through refreshes.
* TODO: allow starting a new game without refreshing the page, including after a successful (and compliant) arrest.
* TODO: adjust AI to enable circling crime spaces but not moving away rather than immediately moving into them.

As far as I can tell, the trademarks and copyrights for the original game have expired.
