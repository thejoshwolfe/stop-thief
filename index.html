      Thief movement rules (in this order):
      <ol>
        <li>For each CLUE, the thief will either MOVE or WAIT.</li>
        <li>(TODO: implement the subway) For each MOVE, the thief will always use the SUBWAY if the thief is on one of the 5 STREET spaces with SUBWAY access, unless the thief has just used the SUBWAY 1 MOVE ago. While using the SUBWAY, the thief cannot be arrested, and a TIP cannot be used. The MOVE after using the SUBWAY is always 1 of the 5 STREET spaces with SUBWAY access (Note: this can be the same STREET space where the thief was 1 MOVE ago.) The next MOVE never uses the SUBWAY (otherwise, the thief would never get away from the subway.).</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, if the thief has just moved onto a DOOR or WINDOW, the thief will continue through to the other side.</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, the thief can move up to 2 board spaces in any direction (including diagonally) to land on a numbered space. If the thief steps onto the street during a MOVE, the thief will stop on a street space; in other words, the thief cannot leap across the street into the door or window of another building in a single MOVE. This establishes the set of available spaces.</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, if there are 1 or more available unused indoor CRIME spaces, the thief will choose randomly from among them and move to it (TODO: don't consider the NEWS STAND an irresistible crime space.). A used indoor CRIME space is considered a FLOOR space until it is restocked, and a used outdoor CRIME space (the NEWS STAND) is considered a STREET space until it is restocked (TODO: currently it's considered a floor space.). Indoor CRIME spaces are restocked when the thief leaves the building (TODO: implement restocking.); the NEWS STAND is restocked after the thief COMPLIES with a CORRECT ARREST.</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, the thief will never move into a numbered space where the thief was last turn, a direct U-turn. (But the thief can move into a space where the thief was 2 turns ago, making a triangle.) (Remember that a CRIME space turns into a FLOOR or STREET space until the CRIME space is restocked.)</li>
        <li>For each MOVE, if none of the above rules have determined the thief's movement space, the thief will choose one of the available spaces randomly.</li>
        <li>(TODO: implement arresting.) After an INCORRECT ARREST, the thief will do nothing.</li>
        <li>After a CORRECT ARREST, the thief will either COMPLY or RUN.</li>
        <li>(TODO: implement running.) For each RUN, the thief will MOVE 5 or 6 times.</li>
      </ol>
      More TODOs:
      <ul>
        <li>TODO: add styling/formatting so this text doesn't look so atrocious.</li>
        <li>TODO: implement TIP.</li>
        <li>TODO: show building number where thief is located.</li>
        <li>TODO: persist state through refreshes.</li>
        <li>TODO: allow starting a new game (without refreshing the page).</li>
